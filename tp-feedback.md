# TP Feedback for Team 14
                                        
**TP Grade**: D+
                                        
## Immersion Design
did not demonstrate any conscious design for particular user experiences
                                        
## Immersion Implementation
implementation is somewhat related to immersion design
                                        
## Evaluation Method
appropriate data collection method was performed but lacks quantity and/or quality
                                        
## Evaluation Analysis
data was thoroughly analysed to form conclusions leading to future work, but quality of analysis may be lacking
                                        
## Documentation
decent documentation but may lack quality in some areas of the README (e.g., unclear instructions/architecture) and/or video demo (e.g., unclear articulations and/or poor footages)
                                        
## Software Engineering
minimal evidence of properly managed software development processes as a team
                                        
## Other feedback
There were no explicit descriptions (video or text) of what the immersion design intentions were or how the implementation relates to those designs. The only vague information was to infer intentions from the experiential concepts tested in the evaluation.

Decent methods employed to collect data based on concepts learned in class, but did not mention why you only chose certain dimensions of flow/presence, etc. The analysis also lacks clarity, e.g., the observations discussed were not clearly/explicitly linked to evidence from the data.

Documentation - README was rather minimal and video was well-voiced although it did not address the required design/implementation information.
Software Engineering - no evidence of software processes provided other than h minimal task distribution seen in the different branches.
