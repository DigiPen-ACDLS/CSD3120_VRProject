# Data collection
For data collection for immersion as user experiences, we gave 10 users a survey that consists of 
questions from iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ), Flow Short Scale questionnaire, and  Virtual 
Reality Sickness Questionnaire(VRSQ) which test for presence, flow, and cybersickness of user 
experience respectively. 

10 individuals which include 5 males, 4 females, and 1 prefer not to say have participated in the 
user experience testing, they mainly come from the age range of 18 to 34. 

Immersion as user experiences is classified into 3 experiential constructs that are popular today, 
presence, flow, and cybersickness. Presence describes the feeling of “being there”. It is affected 
by individual differences, e.g. personalities such as openness and extraversion. Flow is the feeling 
of being “in the zone” and can be described as the mental state of extremely positive engagement. 
Flow has 8 dimensions: clear goals, level of challenge that matches skills, complete concentration, 
loss of self-consciousness, sense of control, effortlessness, the transformation of time, and autotelic 
experience. Lastly, cybersickness is a symptom of sickness due to cyber activities which include nausea, 
dizziness, and disorientation. 

## iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) (http://www.igroup.org/pq/ipq/index.php)

A scale for measuring the sense of presence experienced in a virtual environment (VE).

Based on the IPQ survey results the users find the program immersive. However, the control of the 
actions and movements in the virtual environment and how they feel about how the virtual environment 
responded to their actions and movement is moderate. All users are pleased with the overall experience 
with the program. 

## Flow Short Scale questionnaire

A tool used in psychology research to assess an individual's experience of "flow," which is a state 
of complete absorption and focused concentration in an activity.

Based on the FSS questionnaire, most of the users felt absorbed in the virtual reality experience and 
enjoyed it. The goals were clear in the program, however, the interaction with the environment is not 
challenging enough, and have moderate control over the movement in the environment. We also notice that 
the users were focused during the experience and lost track of time in the real world. 

## Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire(VRSQ)

A tool used to assess symptoms of motion sickness and other discomforts that may arise during the use of 
virtual reality (VR) technology. For our survey, we focus mainly on how intense the symptoms are, 
disorientations when using our application, and discomforts found during the simulation.

Based on the VRSQ survey results, we notice that most users suffer from discomfort and cybersickness, 
mostly having headaches, eye strain, and dizziness, and getting disoriented during the experience. However, 
many indicate that the symptoms weren't intense, indicating a success in mitigating cybersickness to reduce 
symptoms’ effects.

# Conclusion 
We made sure to get everyone’s feedback verbally even after they have done the survey to kind of get their 
immediate opinion on what the experience is like. We also made sure to observe them when they are in VR mode 
to kind of tell how they react to certain things in the scene.

With all the feedback that we have gotten back from play testers we can conclude that our VR application 
causes virtual reality sickness, disorientation and some discomfort to the users. Due to the limitations 
of our knowledge of babylonjs we were unable to optimize the rendering of the VR application hence causing 
low fps rates in VR mode which may cause the symptoms that were mentioned above.

Our interactions were just grabbing planets that were scattered around the lab and based on the information 
that will display as you hover on the planet and arrange these planets in sequence starting from mercury 
which is closest to the sun to neptune. This application has also given our users knowledge on our Solar 
System, such as facts about each planet. All these interactions may be too simple and may not feel as 
immersive.

Lack of interactions might also have made the application less immersive as it may look very stale and 
boring however we have attempted to add in different animations as well as better meshes, textures and 
text planes to improve these problems which took a toll on the fps as well.

# Future works
Based on the user experience results, we need to improve and add more interaction to the program to further 
improve the experience of the user and give them a better sense of presence and flow. We also need to 
solve the issues regarding virtual reality sickness to provide a better and more comfortable experience 
for the users by optimizing the rendering pipeline or by using different applications that we are more 
familiar with such as Unity.
